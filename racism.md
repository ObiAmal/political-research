### Redlining and Housing Discrimination
You can learn about the process of redlining — refusing to insure mortgages in areas around historically blank neighborhoods — [here](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america). One can learn more about how this happened in Seattle (and how it continued after its ostensible banning) [here](https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/online-exhibits/redlining-in-seattle). However, redlining and housing discrimination still continue to this day. 

[This study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alixwinter/files/sampson_winter_2016.pdf) looks at how racial makeup of neighborhoods is related to rates of lead poisoning. It concluded that black neighborhoods, in every year from 1995 to 2013, had a higher rate of lead poisoning than both white and Hispanic neighborhoods. Lead poisoning leads to developmental delays, neurologic changes, irritability, and even death. 

“The profound heterogeneity in the racial ecology of what we call toxic inequality is partially attributable to socioeconomic factors… but controlling [for] these factors, neighborhood prevalence rates of elevated BLL remain closely linked to racial and ethnic segregation.”

According to this [extensive document](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/HUD-514_HDS2012.pdf), black, Asian, and Hispanic people are told about and shown significantly less houses than white people. 

### Employment Discrimination
Even among black and white people with college degrees and similar amounts of experience, black people are being underpaid. According to [this article](https://www.epi.org/blog/black-white-wage-gaps-are-worse-today-than-in-2000/) based on [this study](https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2019/) by the same organization, “Even black workers with an advanced degree experience a significant wage gap compared with their white counterparts. And after controlling for age, gender, education, and region, black workers are paid 14.9% less than white workers.”

Interesting notes from the same article: 
“Therefore, [unions can help shrink the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/labor-day-2019-collective-bargaining/). Related, research has shown that the [decline of unionization led to an expansion of the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/#epi-toc-16).”

Inequality is further perpetuated by employers asking for previous salaries. This allows employers to create a chain of underpaying black workers, as evidenced by [this study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3628729), which found that “employers posted wages more often and increased pay for job changers by about 5%, with larger increases for women (8%) and African-Americans (13%)” after asking for previous salaries was banned. 

Finally, according to a study by [Georgetown University](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/raceandgoodjobs/) (full report available [here](https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Full_Report-The_Unequal_Race_for_Good_Jobs.pdf)), “While Blacks and Latinos have made progress in educational attainment, their odds of having a good job are not as good as those of White workers with the same level of education, reflecting persistent racial disparities in the workforce. In fact, White workers are more likely than Black or Latino workers to have a good job at every level of educational attainment.”

*Methodology Note: *The study defined good jobs as those that “pay at least $35,000 per year, at least $45,000 for workers aged 45 and older, and $65,000 in median earnings in 2016.”

## Racism and Asian-Americans
### Modern-Day Asian Economic Privilege
According to the Census (see [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2018/demo/p60-263/figure1.pdf)), Asian families make more money each year ($81,331) on average than any other race, including white ($68,145), Hispanic ($50,486), and Black ($40,258). To understand the current situation for Asian-Americans, you might want to read [this paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4r7161b2), which discusses how the “model minority” stereotype is used to pit Asian-Americans against black people. It came about from people needing labor after slaves were freed, and from Chinese workers supplanting African-Americans in some areas as ways to get cheap labor. 
* Contradictorily, the racial hegemony has also constructed the notion of the “yellow peril”, the idea that Asians are taking over the country. 
* “The  model minority super-student sparked backlash on campuses in the 1980s, evidenced by racist nicknames denoting prestigious  schools (MIT became "Made In Taiwan"; UCLA was "United Caucasians Lost Among Asians"). In addition, white students began complaining that Asian American students were curve breakers (Wu, 1995, p.  239).”
It is an indisputable fact that Asian Americans are overrepresented at top universities (and at universities in general). This is a demonstration of privilege by outcome, as Asian Americans are not racially superior to any other race.

Yet the “model minority” stereotype is not really a benefit for Asian Americans: being shoved in a box, no matter if it is cardboard or diamond-studded, is never good. We will discuss this in the following sections, alongside how Asian Americans are discriminated against. 

### The Paradox of “Model Minority” and “Yellow Peril”
### Racism Against Asian-Americans in Education
### Modern Racism Against Asian-Americans
First, let’s define the idea of “model minority”. As defined on Wikipedia, a model minority is “a minority demographic (whether based on ethnicity, race or religion) whose members are perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average, thus serving as a reference group to outgroups.” This stereotype of convention success puts pressure on Asians. 

According to [this site](https://adaa.org/finding-help/asian-americans) (run by the nonprofit Anxiety and Depression Association of America), Asian Americans seek mental health services at a third of the rate of non-Asian Americans, despite the fact that “they are more likely to consider and attempt suicide”. The model minority stereotype and the focus on outward success leads people to think that getting help is an admission of weakness, and therefore avoid it. Finally, “research has shown lack of cultural competence in mental health care, which results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.” This is corroborated by [this site](https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/article-mental-health), which even explicitly lists pressure to live up to the “model minority stereotype” as a principal cause of mental health issues!

The Pew Research Center wrote a [report](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/07/01/many-black-and-asian-americans-say-they-have-experienced-discrimination-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/) which found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, Asians are more likely than any other major race (Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white) to have people act uncomfortable around them, be subject to slurs, and to fear that people will physically threaten or attack them for their race or ethnicity (approximately 40%, 30%, and 30% respectively). They are slightly less likely to say that they worry others will be suspicious of them for wearing a mask in public than Black people, but still have this worry at a much higher rate than Hispanic and white people. At the same time, Asians are much less likely to receive support about their race than Black people (and about as likely as Hispanic people). 

Asian Americans have seen a ton of discrimination poured against them during the COVID-19 outbreak, as reported [here](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/asian-americans-report-influx-of-racist-attacks-since-coronavirus-pandemic-data-finds/2327045/). Finally, as previously discussed, Asians were twice as likely to get an interview request if they hid their race (see [this study](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf) found through [this article](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)).
