### Redlining and Housing Discrimination
You can learn about the process of redlining — refusing to insure mortgages in areas around historically blank neighborhoods — [here](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america). One can learn more about how this happened in Seattle (and how it continued after its ostensible banning) [here](https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/online-exhibits/redlining-in-seattle). However, redlining and housing discrimination still continue to this day. 

[This study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alixwinter/files/sampson_winter_2016.pdf) looks at how racial makeup of neighborhoods is related to rates of lead poisoning. It concluded that black neighborhoods, in every year from 1995 to 2013, had a higher rate of lead poisoning than both white and Hispanic neighborhoods. Lead poisoning leads to developmental delays, neurologic changes, irritability, and even death. 

“The profound heterogeneity in the racial ecology of what we call toxic inequality is partially attributable to socioeconomic factors… but controlling [for] these factors, neighborhood prevalence rates of elevated BLL remain closely linked to racial and ethnic segregation.”

According to this [extensive document](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/HUD-514_HDS2012.pdf), black, Asian, and Hispanic people are told about and shown significantly less houses than white people. 

### Employment Discrimination
Even among black and white people with college degrees and similar amounts of experience, black people are being underpaid. According to [this article](https://www.epi.org/blog/black-white-wage-gaps-are-worse-today-than-in-2000/) based on [this study](https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2019/) by the same organization, “Even black workers with an advanced degree experience a significant wage gap compared with their white counterparts. And after controlling for age, gender, education, and region, black workers are paid 14.9% less than white workers.”

Interesting notes from the same article: 
“Therefore, [unions can help shrink the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/labor-day-2019-collective-bargaining/). Related, research has shown that the [decline of unionization led to an expansion of the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/#epi-toc-16).”

Inequality is further perpetuated by employers asking for previous salaries. This allows employers to create a chain of underpaying black workers, as evidenced by [this study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3628729), which found that “employers posted wages more often and increased pay for job changers by about 5%, with larger increases for women (8%) and African-Americans (13%)” after asking for previous salaries was banned. 

Finally, according to a study by [Georgetown University](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/raceandgoodjobs/) (full report available [here](https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Full_Report-The_Unequal_Race_for_Good_Jobs.pdf)), “While Blacks and Latinos have made progress in educational attainment, their odds of having a good job are not as good as those of White workers with the same level of education, reflecting persistent racial disparities in the workforce. In fact, White workers are more likely than Black or Latino workers to have a good job at every level of educational attainment.”

*Methodology Note: *The study defined good jobs as those that “pay at least $35,000 per year, at least $45,000 for workers aged 45 and older, and $65,000 in median earnings in 2016.”

### Wealth Inequality
A great report on the way that demographics intersect with wealth is accessible [here](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/hfs/essays/hfs-essay-1-2015-race-ethnicity-and-wealth.pdf).

It is an indisputable fact that white families have a huge wealth advantage over black families.  [This study](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) by the Federal Reserve as presented by [this article](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/) shows white families with approximately 6.6 times the wealth of black families, and approximately 4.8 times the wealth of Hispanic families. This disparity is present in many areas: white families have 5-6 times the average liquid retirement savings as black or Hispanic families. 

Similarly, white families are 62% more likely to own a house than black families and 48% more likely to own a house than Hispanic families. Another [academic article](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/) stated that “At $171,000, the net worth of a typical white family is nearly ten times greater than that of a Black family ($17,150) in 2016.”. 

### Mental Health
Firstly, Black and Latinx people are diagnosed with mental health disorders at a much higher rate than White people. This is discussed in [this review of the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274585/) on the topic of psychotic disorders, which says “findings reveal a clear and pervasive pattern wherein African American/Black consumers show a rate \[of psychotic disorders\] of on average three to four higher than Euro-American/White consumers. Latino American/Hispanic consumers were also disproportionately diagnosed with psychotic disorders on average approximately three times higher compared to Euro-American/White consumers.”

Yet the literature review states that “this phenomenon has been documented despite the absence of genetic evidence indicating a true increase in prevalence in this population”. In other words, there is no evidence that this demographic trend is a product of biology, and thus it is far likelier that it is a product of the environment and of issues with clinical care. To understand this issue, we will narrow in on the case of schizophrenia, a disorder whose relationship with race has been well-studied. 

The literature review states that African-Americans are nearly 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia: a pattern which does not change if the clinician is African-American (according to [this study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1037/0002-9432.76.2.154)). There is evidence to suggest that this disparity is a product of both the disproportionate hostility of the environment towards Black people and clinical care misdiagnosing the issue.

For example, [this study](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800223) concludes that it agrees with the “large body of literature suggesting that racial differences in the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States result in part from clinicians underemphasizing the relevance of mood symptoms among African Americans compared with other racial-ethnic groups.” Explicitly: “previous investigations have consistently suggested that African Americans with mood disorders are much more likely than other groups to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.” They even suggest a solution: “routine screening for major depression in community mental health settings could reduce racial disparities in schizophrenia diagnoses”. 

Yet the study also states that “etiological explanations may account for these ethnic differences more so than methodological biases”; in particular, it says “greater poverty, discrimination, and cumulative social defeat, which have been hypothesized to increase dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system via sensitization”, could be a contributing factor. This is backed up by [another study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1151017), which found that Black Americans exhibited higher rates of schizophrenia even when diagnosed by experts blinded to race/ethnicity and controlling for a host of factors.

### Healthcare
According to [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469668/), most health care providers appear to have an implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of color. Interventions targeting implicit attitudes among healthcare professionals are needed because implicit bias may contribute to health disparities for people of color. These disparities include the reality that “Black, American Indian and Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, and this disparity increases with age” ([summary](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2019-09-05-cdc-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-continue-pregnancy-related-deaths) and [raw data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6835a3.htm?s_cid=mm6835a3_w)). It also includes the fact that “a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites” ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/)), in particular that they believe that black people have higher pain tolerance and thicker skin (this leads to underprescription of pain medication or people not taking black people’s pain seriously). 

According to [this comprehensive literature search](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532892/) of several databases between May 2015 and September 2016 on 37 qualifying studies, 31 found evidence of pro-White or light-skin/anti-Black, Hispanic, American Indian, or dark-skin bias among a variety of HCPs (health care providers) across multiple levels of training and disciplines. All seven studies that examined the impact of implicit provider bias on real-world patient-provider interaction found that providers with stronger implicit bias demonstrated poorer patient-provider communication.

Besides being a good thing to do naturally, [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563622/) suggests that racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care impose costs on numerous aspects of society, both direct health care costs and indirect costs such as loss of productivity. It estimates that eliminating health disparities for minorities would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by about $230 billion and indirect costs associated with illness and premature death by over $1 trillion during 2003-2006 (dollars adjusted for 2008 inflation).

### The Education System


### Academia
Women and minorities are heavily underrepresented in medical academia, as discussed by [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016508509020344), which states that “The number of underrepresented minorities among US medical school faculty is markedly low when compared with their respective percent representation of the US population. Women URMs are doubly underrepresented…”

Yet minorities do want to be part of STEM academia, as discussed by the American Institute of Physics in [this report](https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/aipcorp/files/teamup-full-report.pdf). The report examined the reasons for the persistent underrepresentation of African-Americans in physics and astronomy in the US and found that African-American students have the same drive, motivation, intellect, and capability to obtain physics and astronomy degrees as students of other ethnicities. It found that the persistent underrepresentation of African-Americans in physics and astronomy follows from (1) the lack of a supportive environment for these students in many departments and (2) financial challenges facing them and the programs that support them.

Of course, there are hiring biases at the top levels of academia, too, as discussed by [this study](http://faculty.fiu.edu/~aeaton/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eaton-Saunders-Jacobson-West-2019.pdf), where biology and physics professors from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical CVs depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. 
* Physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates. Biology faculty rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. 
* Gender also played a part for physics, where Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others.

And yes, we want diversity in academia: according to [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00710.x) on the introduction of minority members to problem-solving groups, “generally positive effects on integrative complexity were found when the groups had racial-and opinion-minority members and when members reported having racially diverse friends and classmates.”. Furthermore, it states that: 

“Previous research has found that racially diverse educational environments are associated with positive intellectual and social outcomes for college students... Frequent interaction across racial lines and discussion of racial and ethnic issues positively predicts student retention, intellectual and social self-concept, and overall satisfaction with college.”

[This book](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sp9c) corroborates the above result. Furthermore, [this study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19905) goes as far as to say that while “persons of similar ethnicity co-author together more frequently than predicted by their proportion among authors”, “greater homophily [similarity between authors] is associated with publication in lower impact journals and with fewer citations, even holding fixed the authors' previous publishing performance.“ In particular, the study states “these findings suggest that diversity in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references leads to greater contributions to science as measured by impact factors and citations.”

### Minority Crime Rates (inc. 13/50)
*Note:* Some groups consider 13/50, 13/52, and 13/90 as hate speech due to their widespread adoption by white supremacist and far-right groups. This is not always the reason it is brought up, but some do bring it up to push a “genetic inferiority” narrative, which *is* hate speech.

The origin of this claim is [from FBI statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls). However, these statistics actually show that Black people were arrested for 38.7% of homicides (people stating 13/50 ignore the category of homicides where the race of the perpetrator was unknown, which is not a statistically unbiased choice). Finally, even when you use the 38.7% figure, the FBI itself has said that its UCR data is unreliable (see [here](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/a-word-about-ucr-data.pdf/view)) for the following reasons: 
* The statistic refers to arrests made, not convictions made, so if police departments are racist and disproportionately arrest black suspects (which they do), then the number of “black homicides” is artificially inflated.
* It relies on voluntary reports, so it suffers from selection bias.
The UCR program has no real means of ensuring that the data they receive is correct. 

Finally, as discussed in the rest of this document being black is linked, through socioeconomic and institutional discrimination and disadvantage, to major predictors of crime. Even if it is true that black people commit more crime (and this is likely correct), it is not a result of genetics (we have debunked that earlier). Thus, it must be a result of the environment: a racist system which America created. The point is to take action to change this. 

### Disenfrachisement of Minorities
Our system of preventing felons from voting is a racially charged method of oppression, as discussed [here](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/6-million-lost-voters-state-level-estimates-felony-disenfranchisement-2016/). “A record 6.1 million Americans are forbidden to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, or laws restricting voting rights for those convicted of felony-level crimes. The number of disenfranchised individuals has increased dramatically… in recent decades, rising from an estimated 1.17 million in 1976 to 6.1 million today.” Importantly: “one in 13 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than that of non-African Americans.”

According to [this page](https://felonvoting.procon.org/international-comparison-of-felon-voting-laws/), only 4 out of 45 countries (Armenia, Belgium, Chile, and the U.S.) ban felons from voting after they have served their sentence. In particular, Belgium only does this with the most severe sentences. [Here](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx) are the specific U.S. laws.

In 2016, Republicans in North Carolina attempted to pass voting restrictions right after requesting a voter breakdown by race. The Supreme Court reviewed these restrictions and issued the following response: “the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision”, the State in essence “took away minority voters’ opportunity because they were about to exercise it.”, and “this bears the mark of intentional discrimination.”

According to [this review of the literature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21565503.2020.1773280), a number of strict voter-ID laws have been implemented across multiple states in the last several years, and they generally hurt minority turnout. Explicitly: “Our primary analysis uses aggregate county turnout data from 2012 to 2016 and finds that the racial gap in turnout between more diverse and less diverse counties grew more in states enacting new strict photo ID laws than it did elsewhere – even after controlling for other factors that could impact turnout. Strict voter ID laws appear to discriminate.” This is likely because minorities are less likely to have valid voting ID, as discussed by [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X18810012), which found black and Latino people to be twice as likely to not have valid voter ID as white people. 

There is evidence to suggest that these voter ID laws are active attempts by Republicans to suppress black voting: according to [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015589804), “among Republican legislators, a higher black district population increases legislators’ support for voter ID, whereas among Democratic lawmakers, a higher black district population reduces legislators’ likelihood of voting in favor of restrictive voter ID legislation”. This is corroborated by [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X16687266), which states that “Republicans [are] more likely to enact a number of these laws in states with large Black and Latino populations, particularly when they first come to power" and "at best this link indicates a lack of effective representation for minorities in this area and at worst an attempt to diminish the influence minority members have on elections.”

## Racism and Asian-Americans
### Modern-Day Asian Economic Privilege
According to the Census (see [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2018/demo/p60-263/figure1.pdf)), Asian families make more money each year ($81,331) on average than any other race, including white ($68,145), Hispanic ($50,486), and Black ($40,258). To understand the current situation for Asian-Americans, you might want to read [this paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4r7161b2), which discusses how the “model minority” stereotype is used to pit Asian-Americans against black people. It came about from people needing labor after slaves were freed, and from Chinese workers supplanting African-Americans in some areas as ways to get cheap labor. 
* Contradictorily, the racial hegemony has also constructed the notion of the “yellow peril”, the idea that Asians are taking over the country. 
* “The  model minority super-student sparked backlash on campuses in the 1980s, evidenced by racist nicknames denoting prestigious  schools (MIT became "Made In Taiwan"; UCLA was "United Caucasians Lost Among Asians"). In addition, white students began complaining that Asian American students were curve breakers (Wu, 1995, p.  239).”
It is an indisputable fact that Asian Americans are overrepresented at top universities (and at universities in general). This is a demonstration of privilege by outcome, as Asian Americans are not racially superior to any other race.

Yet the “model minority” stereotype is not really a benefit for Asian Americans: being shoved in a box, no matter if it is cardboard or diamond-studded, is never good. We will discuss this in the following sections, alongside how Asian Americans are discriminated against. 

### The Paradox of “Model Minority” and “Yellow Peril”
### Racism Against Asian-Americans in Education
### Modern Racism Against Asian-Americans
First, let’s define the idea of “model minority”. As defined on Wikipedia, a model minority is “a minority demographic (whether based on ethnicity, race or religion) whose members are perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average, thus serving as a reference group to outgroups.” This stereotype of convention success puts pressure on Asians. 

According to [this site](https://adaa.org/finding-help/asian-americans) (run by the nonprofit Anxiety and Depression Association of America), Asian Americans seek mental health services at a third of the rate of non-Asian Americans, despite the fact that “they are more likely to consider and attempt suicide”. The model minority stereotype and the focus on outward success leads people to think that getting help is an admission of weakness, and therefore avoid it. Finally, “research has shown lack of cultural competence in mental health care, which results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.” This is corroborated by [this site](https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/article-mental-health), which even explicitly lists pressure to live up to the “model minority stereotype” as a principal cause of mental health issues!

The Pew Research Center wrote a [report](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/07/01/many-black-and-asian-americans-say-they-have-experienced-discrimination-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/) which found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, Asians are more likely than any other major race (Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white) to have people act uncomfortable around them, be subject to slurs, and to fear that people will physically threaten or attack them for their race or ethnicity (approximately 40%, 30%, and 30% respectively). They are slightly less likely to say that they worry others will be suspicious of them for wearing a mask in public than Black people, but still have this worry at a much higher rate than Hispanic and white people. At the same time, Asians are much less likely to receive support about their race than Black people (and about as likely as Hispanic people). 

Asian Americans have seen a ton of discrimination poured against them during the COVID-19 outbreak, as reported [here](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/asian-americans-report-influx-of-racist-attacks-since-coronavirus-pandemic-data-finds/2327045/). Finally, as previously discussed, Asians were twice as likely to get an interview request if they hid their race (see [this study](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf) found through [this article](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)).
