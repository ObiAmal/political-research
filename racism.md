## Explicit Racism
### Neo-Nazism, White Supremacy, and White Nationalism
First, we must understand that neo-Nazism and white supremacy is still a massive problem in the U.S. According to a [joint Washington Post-ABC News Poll](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-poll-aug-16-20-2017/2235/), 9% of Americans believe that it is “acceptable” to hold “neo-Nazi or white supremacist” views. This is dozens of millions of people.

A principal white nationalist argument is that diversity hurts “social cohesion” and contributes to a fragmented society. As a result, the only solution (according to a white nationalist) is the creation of white and black ethno-states. However, their argument’s premise goes against academic consensus. 
* “Guided by a clear conceptual framework, we structure the empirical results of 90 recent studies and observe… ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion” ([link](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309))
* “studies have failed to demonstrate convincingly the crucial link between out-group size and ethnic threat (e.g., Wagner et al. 2006, Schlueter & Scheepers 2010, Savelkoul et al. 2011; but see Schlueter & Wagner 2008).” ([link](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309))
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" src="https://obiamal.github.io/political-research/images/diversity-and-social-cohesion.PNG">
</p>
* The majority of data does not support the negative relationship between interethnic contact and trust, and a plurality of data rejects the existence of such a relationship. Only one category: “intra-neighborhood” scope has a high level of “Support”.
* Indeed, the study finds that in ethnically heterogeneous communities, there is a positive relationship between inter-ethnic contact and trust. 
* [This study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/laibson/files/measuring_trust.pdf) tested 200 students in a trust-based experiment and found no statistically significant negative relationship between diversity and “social cohesion” (as measured from a trust-based experiment). 
* [This longitudinal study](http://www.fisherwilliamson.com/downloads/MPSA040508.FINAL2.pdf) compared the social cohesion of two areas over time where one experienced a large increase in diversity whereas the other did not. The two areas did not differ significantly in how their levels of social cohesion changed over time.

Even if diversity hurts social cohesion, the result is not necessarily that white people are superior. This decrease in social cohesion is far more likely to come from prejudice. This is supported by [this longitudinal study](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/93/3/1211/2332107), which analyzed changes in trust in 22 European countries from 2002 to 2010. It suggests that while immigration can lead to lower social trust, these results were dependent on ethnic polarization & economic stability. With low polarization and a good economy, immigration was shown to actually increase social trust. This suggests that immigration and diversity are not the causes of a decrease in social cohesion, but react with xenophobia to cause a fractured social dynamic. 

### “Race Realism” and Genetics
Firstly, we must acknowledge the reality that genetic differences are not tied to race. For example, [this study](https://www.genetics.org/content/161/1/269) is literally titled “Larger Genetic Differences Within Africans Than Between Africans and Eurasians”. Race realists will similarly claim that genetic differences between individuals are dwarfed by genetic differences between populations, often citing [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/), which ostensibly states that a pair of individuals from one population is never more genetically dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations. However, this is cherry picked: their actual conclusion is: 

“The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population. Thus, caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.”

Furthermore, [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5299519/) found there is broad consensus among anthropologists that “there are no human biological races and recognition that race exists as lived social experiences that can have important effects on health”. An [announcement by Cell](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(18)30363-X) said the same thing, claiming that (among other things):

“Genetics demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories… Genetics exposes the concept of “racial purity” as scientifically meaningless… It follows that there can be no genetics-based support for claiming one group as superior to another. ”

It is incredibly easy to find more and more studies saying this exact same thing: for this I reference the Source Library's section ["Racialism and Race Realism"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UhneOJvvO9vzHIUWfgKWJCCFi0LDNj_3p6LGBkIo6mU/edit#heading=h.nko5z1ken1so). 

### Race IQ Gaps
It is a fact that white people in America have a higher IQ than black people in America (and East Asians have a higher IQ than both). Some people argue a genetic cause, using studies that show East Asians adopted by white parents outperform white children raised by white parents. However, [this study](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/5/1/1) argues that the Flynn Effect and other artifacts account for the entire difference: 
* “Diagnosing these artifacts suggests a nil hypothesis: East Asian, White, and Black adoptees raised in the same environment would have similar IQs, hinting at a minimal role for genes in racial IQ differences.”

Recall that the Flynn Effect is the fact that people tend to perform better on IQ tests over time. For example, [this massive meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/) argues that average IQ performance on set tests is increasing by 3 points/decade (and not slowing down). Genes cannot explain a difference that takes place on the scale of decades or even centuries: thus the Flynn Effect is evidence of the environment’s significant effect on expressed IQ. Even more directly: “Individuals differ in intelligence due to differences in both their environments and genetic heritage. Heritability estimates range from 0.4 to 0.8 (on a scale from 0 to l)” ([link](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf)). This means that the environment contributes to 20-60% of the difference in intelligence between individuals, thereby meaning that the current statistical difference can be entirely explained by the environment. 

Following is more evidence that the Black-White IQ Gap is environmental, not genetic: 
* “As to the cause of the mean Black–White group difference, however, the Task Force concluded: ‘There is certainly no support for a genetic interpretation’” ([link](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-02655-001), page 97)
* “It is often asserted that Black Americans have made no IQ gains on White Americans. Until recently, there has been no adequate data to measure trends in Black IQ. We analyzed data from nine standardization samples for four major tests of cognitive ability. These data suggest that Blacks gained 4 to 7 IQ points on non-Hispanic Whites between 1972 and 2002. Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of Black cognitive ability.” ([link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01802.x)). 
* Historically, people in marginalized groups (Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans) often score lower on IQ tests regardless of race ([link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/6403.pdf)). 

Finally, a lower socioeconomic state can suppress intelligence, according to [this study](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/behavioral-science/2018/article/how-poverty-changes-your-mind-set), which notes that “working through a difficult financial problem produces a cognitive strain that’s equivalent to a 13-point deficit in IQ or a full night’s sleep lost”. Similarly, “in India, where sugarcane farmers are paid annually after the harvest, farmers’ attention scores were the equivalent of 10 IQ points higher than just before the harvest, when farmers were relatively poor”. And this disadvantage is passed on: [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001433) finds that “high and low SES \[socioeconomic background\] children differed by 6 IQ points at age 2” but that by high school, this difference had almost tripled. The point is that Black people suffer from substandard socioeconomic states which lead to significant and propagated IQ differences.

### Workplace Harassment
A government task force on workplace harassment wrote [a report](https://www.eeoc.gov/select-task-force-study-harassment-workplace) which stated that studies supported the claim that a workplace harassment on the basis of race or ethnicity is a widespread problem. For example, the report states that “in one of the first studies of racial and ethnic harassment based on a convenience sample, between 40% and 60% of respondents…  reported experiencing some form of racial or ethnic harassment” and that another study “found that 70% of the respondents reported experiencing… verbal harassment and 45% reported experiencing exclusionary behaviors.”

## Racism by Outcome
### Redlining and Housing Discrimination
You can learn about the process of redlining — refusing to insure mortgages in areas around historically blank neighborhoods — [here](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america). One can learn more about how this happened in Seattle (and how it continued after its ostensible banning) [here](https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/exhibits-and-education/online-exhibits/redlining-in-seattle). However, redlining and housing discrimination still continue to this day. 

[This study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alixwinter/files/sampson_winter_2016.pdf) looks at how racial makeup of neighborhoods is related to rates of lead poisoning. It concluded that black neighborhoods, in every year from 1995 to 2013, had a higher rate of lead poisoning than both white and Hispanic neighborhoods. Lead poisoning leads to developmental delays, neurologic changes, irritability, and even death. 

“The profound heterogeneity in the racial ecology of what we call toxic inequality is partially attributable to socioeconomic factors… but controlling [for] these factors, neighborhood prevalence rates of elevated BLL remain closely linked to racial and ethnic segregation.”

According to this [extensive document](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/HUD-514_HDS2012.pdf), black, Asian, and Hispanic people are told about and shown significantly less houses than white people. 

### Employment Discrimination
Even among black and white people with college degrees and similar amounts of experience, black people are being underpaid. According to [this article](https://www.epi.org/blog/black-white-wage-gaps-are-worse-today-than-in-2000/) based on [this study](https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2019/) by the same organization, “Even black workers with an advanced degree experience a significant wage gap compared with their white counterparts. And after controlling for age, gender, education, and region, black workers are paid 14.9% less than white workers.”

Interesting notes from the same article: 
“Therefore, [unions can help shrink the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/labor-day-2019-collective-bargaining/). Related, research has shown that the [decline of unionization led to an expansion of the black–white wage gap](https://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/#epi-toc-16).”

Inequality is further perpetuated by employers asking for previous salaries. This allows employers to create a chain of underpaying black workers, as evidenced by [this study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3628729), which found that “employers posted wages more often and increased pay for job changers by about 5%, with larger increases for women (8%) and African-Americans (13%)” after asking for previous salaries was banned. 

Finally, according to a study by [Georgetown University](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/raceandgoodjobs/) (full report available [here](https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Full_Report-The_Unequal_Race_for_Good_Jobs.pdf)), “While Blacks and Latinos have made progress in educational attainment, their odds of having a good job are not as good as those of White workers with the same level of education, reflecting persistent racial disparities in the workforce. In fact, White workers are more likely than Black or Latino workers to have a good job at every level of educational attainment.”

*Methodology Note: *The study defined good jobs as those that “pay at least $35,000 per year, at least $45,000 for workers aged 45 and older, and $65,000 in median earnings in 2016.”

### Wealth Inequality
A great report on the way that demographics intersect with wealth is accessible [here](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/hfs/essays/hfs-essay-1-2015-race-ethnicity-and-wealth.pdf).

It is an indisputable fact that white families have a huge wealth advantage over black families.  [This study](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) by the Federal Reserve as presented by [this article](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/) shows white families with approximately 6.6 times the wealth of black families, and approximately 4.8 times the wealth of Hispanic families. This disparity is present in many areas: white families have 5-6 times the average liquid retirement savings as black or Hispanic families. 

Similarly, white families are 62% more likely to own a house than black families and 48% more likely to own a house than Hispanic families. Another [academic article](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/) stated that “At $171,000, the net worth of a typical white family is nearly ten times greater than that of a Black family ($17,150) in 2016.”. 

### Mental Health
Firstly, Black and Latinx people are diagnosed with mental health disorders at a much higher rate than White people. This is discussed in [this review of the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274585/) on the topic of psychotic disorders, which says “findings reveal a clear and pervasive pattern wherein African American/Black consumers show a rate \[of psychotic disorders\] of on average three to four higher than Euro-American/White consumers. Latino American/Hispanic consumers were also disproportionately diagnosed with psychotic disorders on average approximately three times higher compared to Euro-American/White consumers.”

Yet the literature review states that “this phenomenon has been documented despite the absence of genetic evidence indicating a true increase in prevalence in this population”. In other words, there is no evidence that this demographic trend is a product of biology, and thus it is far likelier that it is a product of the environment and of issues with clinical care. To understand this issue, we will narrow in on the case of schizophrenia, a disorder whose relationship with race has been well-studied. 

The literature review states that African-Americans are nearly 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia: a pattern which does not change if the clinician is African-American (according to [this study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1037/0002-9432.76.2.154)). There is evidence to suggest that this disparity is a product of both the disproportionate hostility of the environment towards Black people and clinical care misdiagnosing the issue.

For example, [this study](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800223) concludes that it agrees with the “large body of literature suggesting that racial differences in the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States result in part from clinicians underemphasizing the relevance of mood symptoms among African Americans compared with other racial-ethnic groups.” Explicitly: “previous investigations have consistently suggested that African Americans with mood disorders are much more likely than other groups to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.” They even suggest a solution: “routine screening for major depression in community mental health settings could reduce racial disparities in schizophrenia diagnoses”. 

Yet the study also states that “etiological explanations may account for these ethnic differences more so than methodological biases”; in particular, it says “greater poverty, discrimination, and cumulative social defeat, which have been hypothesized to increase dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system via sensitization”, could be a contributing factor. This is backed up by [another study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1151017), which found that Black Americans exhibited higher rates of schizophrenia even when diagnosed by experts blinded to race/ethnicity and controlling for a host of factors.

### Healthcare
According to [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469668/), most health care providers appear to have an implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of color. Interventions targeting implicit attitudes among healthcare professionals are needed because implicit bias may contribute to health disparities for people of color. These disparities include the reality that “Black, American Indian and Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, and this disparity increases with age” ([summary](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2019-09-05-cdc-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-continue-pregnancy-related-deaths) and [raw data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6835a3.htm?s_cid=mm6835a3_w)). It also includes the fact that “a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites” ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/)), in particular that they believe that black people have higher pain tolerance and thicker skin (this leads to underprescription of pain medication or people not taking black people’s pain seriously). 

According to [this comprehensive literature search](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532892/) of several databases between May 2015 and September 2016 on 37 qualifying studies, 31 found evidence of pro-White or light-skin/anti-Black, Hispanic, American Indian, or dark-skin bias among a variety of HCPs (health care providers) across multiple levels of training and disciplines. All seven studies that examined the impact of implicit provider bias on real-world patient-provider interaction found that providers with stronger implicit bias demonstrated poorer patient-provider communication.

Besides being a good thing to do naturally, [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563622/) suggests that racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care impose costs on numerous aspects of society, both direct health care costs and indirect costs such as loss of productivity. It estimates that eliminating health disparities for minorities would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by about $230 billion and indirect costs associated with illness and premature death by over $1 trillion during 2003-2006 (dollars adjusted for 2008 inflation).

### The Education System
Firstly, the education system as it currently exists is disproportionately hostile towards black people (and other people of color). [This study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619875150?mod=article_inline) finds that “Black students are disciplined more frequently and more severely for the same misbehaviors as White students”. It also found that “Principals endorsed more severe discipline for Black students compared with White students” and “Further, this discipline severity was explained through Black students being more likely to be labeled a troublemaker than White students”. This hostility is explicitly explained in [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038040715587114), which states that: 

“The results generally support hypotheses that schools and districts with relatively larger minority and poor populations are more likely to implement criminalized disciplinary policies, including suspensions and expulsion or police referrals or arrests, and less likely to medicalize students through behavioral plans put in place through laws such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.”

Finally, the outcomes are disproportionately negative for black students, according to the [U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-discipline-snapshot.pdf), which states that black children are consistently being suspended and expelled disproportionately to white kids, even as early as in preschool. Explicitly: “Black students represent 16% of student enrollment, they represent 27% of students referred to law enforcement and 31% of students subjected to a school-related arrest”. Similarly, this [government report](https://sites.ed.gov/whieeaa/files/2016/10/WHIEEAA-Call-for-African-American-Educators-factsheet.pdf) states that “African American students are 2.9 times as likely to be labeled mentally retarded, 1.9 times as likely to be labeled emotionally disturbed, and 1.3 times as likely to be labeled as having a learning disability as their white peers”. 

Furthermore, schools that serve minorities are often funded worse and therefore substandard in a variety of ways that affect educational achievement. Here are some ways in which this happens: 

**1:** Less access to experienced teachers: According to [this report](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/CRDC-Teacher-Equity-Snapshot.pdf), “Black, Latino, American Indian and Native-Alaskan students attend schools with higher concentrations of first-year teachers at a higher rate (3 to 4%) than white students (1%). English learners also attend these schools at slightly higher rates (3%) than non-English learners (2%).”

**2:** Lower wages for teachers: According to [this report](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/CRDC-Teacher-Equity-Snapshot.pdf),  “Nearly one in four districts with two or more high schools reports a teacher salary gap of more than $5,000 between high schools with the highest and the lowest black and Latino student enrollments.”

**3:** Less access to certified teachers: According to [this report](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/CRDC-Teacher-Equity-Snapshot.pdf), “nearly 7% of the nation’s black students – totaling over half a million students – attend schools where 80% or fewer of teachers \[are certified\]; black students are more than four times as likely, and Latino students twice as likely, as white students to attend these schools.”

**4:** Less high-level or AP classes: According to [this report](https://cdn.uncf.org/wp-content/uploads/PDFs/CRDC-College-and-Career-Readiness-Snapshot-2.pdf), 
* A quarter of high schools with the highest percentage of black and Latino students do not offer Algebra II; a third of these schools do not offer chemistry. Fewer than half of American Indian and Native-Alaskan high school students have access to the full range of math and science courses in their high school.
* Advanced Placement (AP) course enrollment and testing: Black and Latino students make up 37% of students in high schools, 27% of students enrolled in at least one Advanced Placement (AP) course, and 18% of students receiving a qualifying score of 3 or above on an AP exam. 

**5:** Less college preparation: According to [this report](https://cdn.uncf.org/wp-content/uploads/PDFs/6201-CCCR-African-American-2015.pdf), academic gaps begin before high school and continue through high school, so African American students are academically underprepared for college in large numbers. Also, they often have to take or retake remedial classes because of this disadvantage, causing them to fall further behind and waste money. Finally, African American students are more likely to be in schools that offer less rigorous courses, which can hamper the college admissions process.

Also, 19% of teachers of color leave the profession each year compared to just 15% of white teachers, as discussed by [this study](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Diversifying_Teaching_Profession_REPORT_0.pdf) (page 15). The same study provides evidence (see page 8) that teachers of color have to move around more often: 10% of teachers of color move schools each year, compared to 8% of white teachers. 

Yet having a BIPOC teacher increases the academic success of a BIPOC student substantially, according to [this study](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Diversifying_Teaching_Profession_REPORT_0.pdf), which contains the following quote: “Black boys from low-income families who had at least one Black teacher in grades 3 to 5 were 39% less likely to drop out of high school than those who had never had a Black teacher. For Black students identified as “persistently low-income”... having a Black teacher increased their intentions of going to college by 19%, and by 29% for Black boys” (page 13). This is backed up by a Johns Hopkins academic article which states that “Black students who’d had just one black teacher by third grade were 13 percent more likely to enroll in college – and those who’d had two were 32 percent more likely.”

Interestingly, [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X16671718) (page 6) finds that BIPOC teachers are generally more appreciated by all students than white teachers. Explicitly, across various models controlling for student, teacher, and school conditions, Black and Latinx teachers scored well above average in the majority of the seven categories examined. In particular, Latinx teachers were above average in every category and Black teachers were above average in 5 out of the 7 categories. White teachers were above average in only 1 of 7 categories. I hypothesize this is not because BIPOC are more effective teachers, but because they add to the diversity into the classroom, thereby offering something unique to their students. 

Minorities are underrepresented as teachers compared to students (this table is sourced from [here](https://sites.ed.gov/whieeaa/files/2016/10/WHIEEAA-Call-for-African-American-Educators-factsheet.pdf)): 

<p align="center">

There is obscene underrepresentation of BIPOC students in public gifted programs. According to [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858415622175), black students appear at 59% the expected rate (Hispanic students appear at 69% the expected rate). Gifted programs can be a force for good: the same study states that “studies have linked participation in gifted programs to positive future outcomes, including increased academic performance and improvements in… motivation, self-efficacy, engagement with learning, nonacademic self-concept, and overall stress”. However, they are forces for inequality when they discriminate across racial lines. 

One way to help fix this issue is universal screening, which substantially increases the proportion of minorities in gifted programs, as discussed by [this study](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/13678) (corroborated by [link](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/universal-screening-NBER21519.pdf)). The study discusses Broward County, which created a universal screening process and ran it in 2004-2005. The results were tremendous for minorities: “The impacts for Blacks and Hispanics are also very large: The odds rose by 74% for Blacks and by 118% for Hispanics (the difference between these two estimates is not significant; P = 0.44.) By contrast, the impact for Whites is relatively small (12%) and differs significantly from the impact for Blacks and Hispanics combined (P < 0.01).”

In particular, the current nomination processes (more than the tests) contribute to structural inequality: 
* “In my opinion, the nomination stage of the gifted identification process has long been the elephant in the room in terms of understanding disproportional representation of students from racial minority or low socioeconomic status backgrounds in gifted education programs. Far more research has examined ability and achievement tests for potential bias and generally has not found evidence for it, at least with respect to test content” — McBee in JAA ([link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1932202X16634141)).
* “Why was universal screening so effective? The only plausible explanation is that the usual nominating process failed to identify large numbers of students, particularly racially diverse and low-income students, who were capable of earning qualifying scores on the confirmatory assessment.” — McBee in JAA ([link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1932202X16634141)). 

It is also worth considering the Pygmalion effect. The Pygmalion effect refers to the phenomenon of students performing better when their teachers have higher expectations for them. For example, in [this study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02322211), it was found that when teachers had an expectation that students would experience a “growth spurt” of intelligence, those students did indeed increase their IQ scores at a higher-than-average rate. Yet [this study](https://education.msu.edu/green-and-write/2016/study-teachers-have-lower-expectations-for-black-students/) states that “... white teachers tend to have lower expectations of black students than do black teachers. Compared to black teachers, non-black teachers were 12% more likely to predict that a black student wouldn’t finish high school and were 9% less likely to predict that a black student would complete at least a 4-year degree.” You can connect the dots to see the issue. 

Similarly, “stereotype threat” refers to the fact that people will worry about reinforcing a negative stereotype about their race, gender, etc. and will thus tend to perform worse due to added pressure. This is discussed further in [this article](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov04/vol62/num03/The-Threat-of-Stereotype.aspx). This is not a solely a black-and-white issue: according to the article, “my colleagues and I found that white male engineering students (with astronomical SAT math scores) performed significantly worse on a difficult math test when we told them that their performance would help us understand Asians' mathematical superiority.”

### Academia
Women and minorities are heavily underrepresented in medical academia, as discussed by [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016508509020344), which states that “The number of underrepresented minorities among US medical school faculty is markedly low when compared with their respective percent representation of the US population. Women URMs are doubly underrepresented…”

Yet minorities do want to be part of STEM academia, as discussed by the American Institute of Physics in [this report](https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/aipcorp/files/teamup-full-report.pdf). The report examined the reasons for the persistent underrepresentation of African-Americans in physics and astronomy in the US and found that African-American students have the same drive, motivation, intellect, and capability to obtain physics and astronomy degrees as students of other ethnicities. It found that the persistent underrepresentation of African-Americans in physics and astronomy follows from (1) the lack of a supportive environment for these students in many departments and (2) financial challenges facing them and the programs that support them.

Of course, there are hiring biases at the top levels of academia, too, as discussed by [this study](http://faculty.fiu.edu/~aeaton/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eaton-Saunders-Jacobson-West-2019.pdf), where biology and physics professors from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical CVs depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. 
* Physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates. Biology faculty rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. 
* Gender also played a part for physics, where Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others.

And yes, we want diversity in academia: according to [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00710.x) on the introduction of minority members to problem-solving groups, “generally positive effects on integrative complexity were found when the groups had racial-and opinion-minority members and when members reported having racially diverse friends and classmates.”. Furthermore, it states that: 

“Previous research has found that racially diverse educational environments are associated with positive intellectual and social outcomes for college students... Frequent interaction across racial lines and discussion of racial and ethnic issues positively predicts student retention, intellectual and social self-concept, and overall satisfaction with college.”

[This book](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sp9c) corroborates the above result. Furthermore, [this study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19905) goes as far as to say that while “persons of similar ethnicity co-author together more frequently than predicted by their proportion among authors”, “greater homophily [similarity between authors] is associated with publication in lower impact journals and with fewer citations, even holding fixed the authors' previous publishing performance.“ In particular, the study states “these findings suggest that diversity in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references leads to greater contributions to science as measured by impact factors and citations.”

### Minority Crime Rates (inc. 13/50)
*Note:* Some groups consider 13/50, 13/52, and 13/90 as hate speech due to their widespread adoption by white supremacist and far-right groups. This is not always the reason it is brought up, but some do bring it up to push a “genetic inferiority” narrative, which *is* hate speech.

The origin of this claim is [from FBI statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls). However, these statistics actually show that Black people were arrested for 38.7% of homicides (people stating 13/50 ignore the category of homicides where the race of the perpetrator was unknown, which is not a statistically unbiased choice). Finally, even when you use the 38.7% figure, the FBI itself has said that its UCR data is unreliable (see [here](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/a-word-about-ucr-data.pdf/view)) for the following reasons: 
* The statistic refers to arrests made, not convictions made, so if police departments are racist and disproportionately arrest black suspects (which they do), then the number of “black homicides” is artificially inflated.
* It relies on voluntary reports, so it suffers from selection bias.
The UCR program has no real means of ensuring that the data they receive is correct. 

Finally, as discussed in the rest of this document being black is linked, through socioeconomic and institutional discrimination and disadvantage, to major predictors of crime. Even if it is true that black people commit more crime (and this is likely correct), it is not a result of genetics (we have debunked that earlier). Thus, it must be a result of the environment: a racist system which America created. The point is to take action to change this. 

### Disenfrachisement of Minorities
Our system of preventing felons from voting is a racially charged method of oppression, as discussed [here](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/6-million-lost-voters-state-level-estimates-felony-disenfranchisement-2016/). “A record 6.1 million Americans are forbidden to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, or laws restricting voting rights for those convicted of felony-level crimes. The number of disenfranchised individuals has increased dramatically… in recent decades, rising from an estimated 1.17 million in 1976 to 6.1 million today.” Importantly: “one in 13 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than that of non-African Americans.”

According to [this page](https://felonvoting.procon.org/international-comparison-of-felon-voting-laws/), only 4 out of 45 countries (Armenia, Belgium, Chile, and the U.S.) ban felons from voting after they have served their sentence. In particular, Belgium only does this with the most severe sentences. [Here](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx) are the specific U.S. laws.

In 2016, Republicans in North Carolina attempted to pass voting restrictions right after requesting a voter breakdown by race. The Supreme Court reviewed these restrictions and issued the following response: “the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision”, the State in essence “took away minority voters’ opportunity because they were about to exercise it.”, and “this bears the mark of intentional discrimination.”

According to [this review of the literature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21565503.2020.1773280), a number of strict voter-ID laws have been implemented across multiple states in the last several years, and they generally hurt minority turnout. Explicitly: “Our primary analysis uses aggregate county turnout data from 2012 to 2016 and finds that the racial gap in turnout between more diverse and less diverse counties grew more in states enacting new strict photo ID laws than it did elsewhere – even after controlling for other factors that could impact turnout. Strict voter ID laws appear to discriminate.” This is likely because minorities are less likely to have valid voting ID, as discussed by [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X18810012), which found black and Latino people to be twice as likely to not have valid voter ID as white people. 

There is evidence to suggest that these voter ID laws are active attempts by Republicans to suppress black voting: according to [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015589804), “among Republican legislators, a higher black district population increases legislators’ support for voter ID, whereas among Democratic lawmakers, a higher black district population reduces legislators’ likelihood of voting in favor of restrictive voter ID legislation”. This is corroborated by [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X16687266), which states that “Republicans [are] more likely to enact a number of these laws in states with large Black and Latino populations, particularly when they first come to power" and "at best this link indicates a lack of effective representation for minorities in this area and at worst an attempt to diminish the influence minority members have on elections.”

## Racism and Asian-Americans
### Modern-Day Asian Economic Privilege
According to the Census (see [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2018/demo/p60-263/figure1.pdf)), Asian families make more money each year ($81,331) on average than any other race, including white ($68,145), Hispanic ($50,486), and Black ($40,258). To understand the current situation for Asian-Americans, you might want to read [this paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4r7161b2), which discusses how the “model minority” stereotype is used to pit Asian-Americans against black people. It came about from people needing labor after slaves were freed, and from Chinese workers supplanting African-Americans in some areas as ways to get cheap labor. 
* Contradictorily, the racial hegemony has also constructed the notion of the “yellow peril”, the idea that Asians are taking over the country. 
* “The  model minority super-student sparked backlash on campuses in the 1980s, evidenced by racist nicknames denoting prestigious  schools (MIT became "Made In Taiwan"; UCLA was "United Caucasians Lost Among Asians"). In addition, white students began complaining that Asian American students were curve breakers (Wu, 1995, p.  239).”
It is an indisputable fact that Asian Americans are overrepresented at top universities (and at universities in general). This is a demonstration of privilege by outcome, as Asian Americans are not racially superior to any other race.

Yet the “model minority” stereotype is not really a benefit for Asian Americans: being shoved in a box, no matter if it is cardboard or diamond-studded, is never good. We will discuss this in the following sections, alongside how Asian Americans are discriminated against. 

### The Paradox of “Model Minority” and “Yellow Peril”
### Racism Against Asian-Americans in Education
### Modern Racism Against Asian-Americans
First, let’s define the idea of “model minority”. As defined on Wikipedia, a model minority is “a minority demographic (whether based on ethnicity, race or religion) whose members are perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average, thus serving as a reference group to outgroups.” This stereotype of convention success puts pressure on Asians. 

According to [this site](https://adaa.org/finding-help/asian-americans) (run by the nonprofit Anxiety and Depression Association of America), Asian Americans seek mental health services at a third of the rate of non-Asian Americans, despite the fact that “they are more likely to consider and attempt suicide”. The model minority stereotype and the focus on outward success leads people to think that getting help is an admission of weakness, and therefore avoid it. Finally, “research has shown lack of cultural competence in mental health care, which results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.” This is corroborated by [this site](https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/article-mental-health), which even explicitly lists pressure to live up to the “model minority stereotype” as a principal cause of mental health issues!

The Pew Research Center wrote a [report](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/07/01/many-black-and-asian-americans-say-they-have-experienced-discrimination-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/) which found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, Asians are more likely than any other major race (Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white) to have people act uncomfortable around them, be subject to slurs, and to fear that people will physically threaten or attack them for their race or ethnicity (approximately 40%, 30%, and 30% respectively). They are slightly less likely to say that they worry others will be suspicious of them for wearing a mask in public than Black people, but still have this worry at a much higher rate than Hispanic and white people. At the same time, Asians are much less likely to receive support about their race than Black people (and about as likely as Hispanic people). 

Asian Americans have seen a ton of discrimination poured against them during the COVID-19 outbreak, as reported [here](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/asian-americans-report-influx-of-racist-attacks-since-coronavirus-pandemic-data-finds/2327045/). Finally, as previously discussed, Asians were twice as likely to get an interview request if they hid their race (see [this study](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf) found through [this article](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)).
