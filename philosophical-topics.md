# The Nature of “Politics”

In recent times, the use of the word "politics" has become muddled. When faced with an ongoing protest, some people will complain about discussions getting "too political" or state that they’re just "not interested in politics". In response, some people might say something like "human rights shouldn’t be a political issue." All of these people are using the word "political" like the word "partisan". Yet politics is a much deeper topic than red vs. blue: politics originated as the discussion of how we should organize society to make sure that as many people as possible have the chance to achieve *eudaimonia*, an Aristotlean term for “a flourishing life” that could also be translated as “prosperity”. 

Indeed, the word “politics” comes from the word *politeia*, a word which roughly translates to “constitution”. To Aristotle, “constitution” literally meant “an ordering of the inhabitants of a society” [source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-politics/#PolView). Aristotle believed that there was some telos (ultimate goal) which all society reaches towards: eudaimonia. We might disagree on what eudaimonia is, but most of us would agree it cannot be forced upon someone: a person could be given every material object they could ever ask for and still be deeply unsatisfied. Perhaps even more importantly, Aristotle explicitly stated that satisfaction without choice was unworthy of the dignity of humans. The role of the government, then, is not to prescribe eudaimonia, but to try to create the best conditions to allow people the opportunity to flourish. 

Aristotle believed that humans were vulnerable: he decided the government must address issues such as “the purity of the water supply and the quality of air, as well as education” (page 127). The Roman Stoics held a different opinion: they believed that “all humans, just by virtue of being human, had dignity”  (page 129). However, they went further, holding that material conditions were utterly unimportant; for example, they believed that slaves should be respected, but did not denounce the institution of slavery. Of course, Aristotle had his issues too. He also saw no problem with slavery and believed that women, immigrants, manual laborers, farmers, and sailors did not deserve citizenship. Despite the flaws in these ideologies, modern work on human rights (and the related notion of “capabilities”) is built on a synthesis of these two ideas: that all humans have dignity, but that this inherent dignity can be infringed by severely undesirable external conditions. In particular, almost every modern political philosophy agrees that the structure of society must in some way provide desirable external conditions. 

The influences of these political ideas (and many like them) continue to this day. For example, the Stoics believed that "we should treat the artificial distinctions created by society as trivial and insignificant" (page 129), an opinion that is mirrored by modern-day neoliberals when they reject the notion that the government should correct for unequal external conditions for different races, genders, or classes. To create a coherent political framework, we must begin with a philosophical idea of what the ultimate goals of society, and the government or institutions that organize it, are. Only once we agree on where we are going can we begin to discuss how we will get there.
