# The Nature of “Politics”

*This section is inspired by and draws from Martha Nussbaum’s book "Creating Capabilities". Any quotes which are followed by (page \_\_\_) are taken from that page of the first edition of said book.*

In recent times, the use of the word "politics" has become muddled. When faced with an ongoing protest, some people will complain about discussions getting "too political" or state that they’re just "not interested in politics". In response, some people might say something like "human rights shouldn’t be a political issue." All of these people are using the word "political" like the word "partisan". Yet politics is a much deeper topic than red vs. blue: politics originated as the discussion of how we should organize society to make sure that as many people as possible have the chance to achieve *eudaimonia*, an Aristotlean term for “a flourishing life” that could also be translated as “prosperity”. 

Indeed, the word “politics” comes from the word *politeia*, a word which roughly translates to “constitution”. To Aristotle, “constitution” literally meant “an ordering of the inhabitants of a society” [source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-politics/#PolView). Aristotle believed that there was some telos (ultimate goal) which all society reaches towards: eudaimonia. We might disagree on what eudaimonia is, but most of us would agree it cannot be forced upon someone: a person could be given every material object they could ever ask for and still be deeply unsatisfied. Perhaps even more importantly, Aristotle explicitly stated that satisfaction without choice was unworthy of the dignity of humans. The role of the government, then, is not to prescribe eudaimonia, but to try to create the best conditions to allow people the opportunity to flourish. 

Aristotle believed that humans were vulnerable: he decided the government must address issues such as “the purity of the water supply and the quality of air, as well as education” (page 127). The Roman Stoics held a different opinion: they believed that “all humans, just by virtue of being human, had dignity”  (page 129). However, they went further, holding that material conditions were utterly unimportant; for example, they believed that slaves should be respected, but did not denounce the institution of slavery. Of course, Aristotle had his issues too. He also saw no problem with slavery and believed that women, immigrants, manual laborers, farmers, and sailors did not deserve citizenship. Despite the flaws in these ideologies, modern work on human rights (and the related notion of “capabilities”) is built on a synthesis of these two ideas: that all humans have dignity, but that this inherent dignity can be infringed by severely undesirable external conditions. In particular, almost every modern political philosophy agrees that the structure of society must in some way provide desirable external conditions. 

The influences of these political ideas (and many like them) continue to this day. For example, the Stoics believed that "we should treat the artificial distinctions created by society as trivial and insignificant" (page 129), an opinion that is mirrored by modern-day neoliberals when they reject the notion that the government should correct for unequal external conditions for different races, genders, or classes. To create a coherent political framework, we must begin with a philosophical idea of what the ultimate goals of society, and the government or institutions that organize it, are. Only once we agree on where we are going can we begin to discuss how we will get there.

# Epistemic Injustice

Epistemic injustice is a term introduced by Miranda Fricker in her book of the same name ([source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josp.12348)). At a core level, epistemic injustice means that someone is being wronged as a knower, that they have been discriminated against in their means of receiving or sharing knowledge. This name comes from epistemology, the branch of philosophy associated with the study of knowledge and the truth. Many scholars have discussed and expounded theories about epistemic injustice, but we will mention a few cases of epistemic injustice to do with modern social issues: 

1. *Testimonial injustice* is when people are given more or less credibility as a knower based on their audience's prejudices. Fricker specifically refers to Duwayne Brooks, who saw his friend murdered but could not convince the police who arrived at his call to trust him and go after the assailants (on account of his race). Another example is our tendency to prioritize the written word over oral tradition, despite the intricate and beautiful history behind the latter ([source](https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&context=bai)).
2. Over time, *hermeneutical injustice* is when someone’s experiences aren’t taken seriously or understood because those experiences don’t fit the norm (i.e. there is no language to describe their experiences). This can happen externally, when people are not able to describe their struggles, but it can also happen internally, preventing people from understanding their own situation simply because nobody has ever studied or reported on their experience. This is only counteracted when people study concepts of their own creation, such as misogynoir for female black writers or feminists’ study of gender as a social construct.
3. Related is the stifling of history can be used to break down people’s connection to their own cultures over generations. For example, African-Americans are often presented with a lacking or twisted depiction of Africa as inferior, ignoring the great achievements of the region. Many of the greatest people in history are from pre-colonial African civilizations (such as Mansa Musa, commonly described as [the richest person to ever live](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47379458) and [a patron of the arts who created a massive university and one of the largest libraries in the world](https://www.historyrevealed.com/eras/medieval/the-richest-man-in-history-mansa-musa-i-of-mali/)). 
4. Finally, we must think about how we get knowledge: the exploitative processes by which people have done science and gathered data. For example, the father of modern gynecology was a piece of shit who experimented on non-consenting slaves (gynecology is the study of medical conditions specific to women, especially the female reproductive system). In a very literal sense, thousands or even millions of people have profited from this torture. 
5. There are many more forms of epistemic injustice, but we cannot cover them all here. 

This philosophical concept is of critical importance for our project, which centers around spreading knowledge. We must be aware of how epistemic injustice affects our work: the obscuring of knowledge does not happen randomly, but along lines of privilege and disadvantage.
