## Good- and Bad-Faith Debate

I ascribe to the following quote, which comes from John Reed, author of *How to Spot Dishonest Arguments* ([source](https://johntreed.com/blogs/john-t-reed-s-news-blog/60887299-intellectually-honest-and-intellectually-dishonest-debate-tactics)): 

“There are only two intellectually-honest debate tactics:
1. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s facts, and
2. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s logic.” 

Similar is Paul Graham’s [Pyramid of Disagreement](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html), which argues that there is a “hierarchy of disagreement”, where the higher-up forms of disagreement are more intellectually honest. Wikipedia contains [this helpful diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#/media/File:Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg) which summarizes Graham's points. The pyramid might seem obvious, but being conscious about your aims can help you stay focused in the heat of a debate.

In short, a bad-faith actor is someone who does not enter a debate to learn or participate in a Socratic dialogue. It is someone who enters to “win” (usually, this means making themselves appear strong to the audience) and relies on invalid argumentative techniques (as discussed later) to do so. One red flag of a bad-faith actor is a lack of a consistent ideology; obvious contradictions usually means that the actor hasn’t actually grappled with critique. Yet it’s important to remember that calling someone a bad-faith actor to put them down instead of trying to better the conversation is itself bad-faith acting.

## Valid Argumentative Techniques

In general, there are many more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right. For this reason, analyzing valid argumentative techniques is much more simple than analyzing invalid ones. 

### Logical Steps

When trying to prove a statement deductively (with pure logic), one should rely on the [rules of inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference), the [rules of replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_replacement), and the [valid syllogistic forms](http://markmcintire.com/phil/validforms.html#). There is no need to list them out here: virtually all valid rules or forms are immediately intuitive, and almost all invalid rules or forms are obviously invalid (though some find the ideas of [existential import](http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/hhill/pl120/notes/existential%20import.htm) and the [existential fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy) genuinely confusing). One interesting technique in pure logic is proof by contradiction. This argumentative technique is also called *[reductio ad absurdum](https://iep.utm.edu/reductio/)*, and begins with the acceptance of a position, and the derivation of something absurd (in the logical sense). 

There is a fabulous quote by G.H. Hardy on this technique: “Reductio ad absurdum... is a far finer gambit then any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game” ([source](http://web.mnstate.edu/peil/geometry/Logic/6logic.htm)).

However, not all statements need to be proven deductively. Inductive arguments are arguments that do not prove their conclusion with total certainty, but rather argue the conclusion is extremely likely. Inductive arguments are not judged by their logical consistency, but by how "strong" or "weak" they are. For example, when done correctly, an argument from analogy can serve as inductive justification for a particular position. Of course, creating a false analogy is a fallacy, and determining what is “false” is hard, but this doesn’t mean that arguments from analogy are worthless. Another example of strong inductive reasoning is the process of using a large random sample of a population to reason about the entire population. [Here](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-inductive-reasoning.html) are more examples of inductive reasoning.

### Good-Faith Debate Tactics

Here is a list of tactics that might not help you make your opponent “look bad”, but will ultimately help you convince them to change their mind. 
* *Stay calm.* Stereotypes about the overemotional abound; these stereotypes are undoubtedly harmful, but for the sake of optics it’s important to avoid them. 
* *Concede good points and point out when your opponent gets something right.* Dogmatically refusing to admit nuance in your conversation partner’s position (even when, to you, it seems like they have none) will only lock away the possibility for
* *Accept small changes.* You don’t need to compromise, but be prepared to accept small steps by your partner in the right direction. Ideology change does not happen all at once. 
* *Study your partner.* On one hand, understanding your opponent’s positions and tendencies will be helpful to prepare for their arguments or catch them in logical inconsistencies. On the other, it can help educate you on what your partner is missing or what arguments will be most effective.
* *Require a consistent ideology.* Tu quoque (discussed later) is a fallacy, but it is absolutely reasonable to require that each point of your partner’s ideology agrees with earlier points. 
* *Steel man your partner’s position.* Instead of trying to find a weak version of your opponent’s argument, find a strong version. Make their argument as effective as possible and restate it to them so that (1) you’re sure you understand them and (2) they know you’re listening to them. 
And, of course, avoid the fallacies and bad-faith debate tactics discussed later in this chapter.
