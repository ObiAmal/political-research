## Good- and Bad-Faith Debate

I ascribe to the following quote, which comes from John Reed, author of *How to Spot Dishonest Arguments* ([source](https://johntreed.com/blogs/john-t-reed-s-news-blog/60887299-intellectually-honest-and-intellectually-dishonest-debate-tactics)): 
“There are only two intellectually-honest debate tactics:
1. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s facts, and
2. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s logic.”
