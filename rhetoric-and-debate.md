## Good- and Bad-Faith Debate

I ascribe to the following quote, which comes from John Reed, author of *How to Spot Dishonest Arguments* ([source](https://johntreed.com/blogs/john-t-reed-s-news-blog/60887299-intellectually-honest-and-intellectually-dishonest-debate-tactics)): 

“There are only two intellectually-honest debate tactics:
1. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s facts, and
2. pointing out errors or omissions in your opponent’s logic.” 

Similar is Paul Graham’s [Pyramid of Disagreement](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html), which argues that there is a “hierarchy of disagreement”, where the higher-up forms of disagreement are more intellectually honest. Wikipedia contains [this helpful diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#/media/File:Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg) which summarizes Graham's points. The pyramid might seem obvious, but being conscious about your aims can help you stay focused in the heat of a debate.

In short, a bad-faith actor is someone who does not enter a debate to learn or participate in a Socratic dialogue. It is someone who enters to “win” (usually, this means making themselves appear strong to the audience) and relies on invalid argumentative techniques (as discussed later) to do so. One red flag of a bad-faith actor is a lack of a consistent ideology; obvious contradictions usually means that the actor hasn’t actually grappled with critique. Yet it’s important to remember that calling someone a bad-faith actor to put them down instead of trying to better the conversation is itself bad-faith acting.
