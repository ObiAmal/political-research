## National Demographics

This data is taken from the [U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts page](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219), dated July 1st, 2019. At this time, the United States’ population was approximately 328 million (as of 2020, sources estimate 329 million), and it has grown approximately 6.3% since 2010. More detailed data (on age, sex, by-state data, and so on) is [here](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf). 

*Note:* in this section “people counted by the U.S. Census” is shortened to “people” for the sake of brevity.

*Age Distribution:*
* 6% of the population is under 5 years of age.
* 22.3% of the population is under 18 years of age. 
* 61.2% of the population is between 18 and 65 years of age.
* 16.5% of the population is over 65 years of age.

*Sex Distribution:* 
* 50.8% of the population is biologically female
* 49.2% of the population is biologically male. 

*Racial and Ethnic Distribution:*
* 76.3% of the population is white.
* 60.1% of the population is white non-Hispanic or Latinx. 
* 18.5% of the population is Hispanic or Latinx.
* 13.4% of the population is Black/African-American.
* 5.9% of the population is Asian. 
* 1.3% of the population is American Indian and Alaska Native.
* 0.2% of the population is Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.
* Only 2.8% of the population is two or more races. 

*Interesting Facts:*
* 13.5% of of the population foreign-born. 
* 21.5% of families speak a language other than English at home. 
* 88.8% of families have a computer at home (only 80.4% have an internet subscription). 
* 31.5% of the population over 25 in the U.S. have a Bachelor’s degree (or higher). 
* 10.0% of the population under 65 do not have healthcare. 
* 11.8% of the population are under the poverty line. 

It is difficult to find information about LGBT+ demographics (likely an issue of epistemic injustice). This (slightly dated) [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx) estimates that approximately 4.5% of people identify as LGBT+ (about 5% of women and 4% of men). However, since Gallup finds this number is rising, and this poll is from 2017, it is likely an underestimate. One's likelihood to identify as LGBT+ is heavily correlated with age: 8.2% of millenials identify as LGBT+ compared to just just 1.4% of the Silent Generation (and 2.4% of the Boomer Generation). 

Another slightly dated [study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) from the UCLA Williams Institute suggests that only 0.6% of people identify as transgender. The Williams Insitute also provides some more interesting stats on LGBT+ people and their situation [here](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT#demographic).

*Interesting note:* according to a Gallup poll, Americans significantly overestimate [the LGBT population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/259571/americans-greatly-overestimate-gay-population.aspx) and [the Black and Hispanic population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/4435/Public-Overestimates-US-Black-Hispanic-Populations.aspx). 

## Wealth Demographics

The Pew Research Center created [a report](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/) with series of charts that illustrate economic inequality in this country. The first graph focuses on the increasing income inequality, and the second focuses on the increasing weal inequality. 

Income Inequality | Wealth Inequality
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
![](/images/income-inequality.png) | ![](/images/wealth-inequality.png)

In particular, the report finds that, in the past two decades, growth in median household income (accounting for inflation) "slowed to an annual average rate of only 0.3%", compared with 1.2% for the previous three deacdes. Similarly, it finds that the median household wealth of American families is "currently no higher than its level two decades ago". This inequality can be traced to the Great Recession: the report finds that the wealthiest families are "the only ones to have experienced gains in wealth in the years after the start of the Great Recession in 2007." In the top quintile, median net worth increased by 13% between 2007 and 2016; in contrast, "the net worth of families in lower tiers of wealth decreased by at least 20%" (and up to 39%, in the case of the second-lowest quintile) in the same timeframe. 

In the left and center of the next image are two metrics of income inequality: one showing how income inequality is rising, and another showing how the U.S. has the highest wealth inequality of any G-7 country.

To the right is an image from a Harvard Business Study, [Norton and Ariely 2011](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Norton_Michael_Building%20a%20better%20America%20One%20wealth%20quintile%20at%20a%20time_4c575dff-fe1d-4002-b61a-1227d08b71be.pdf), which shows the extreme differences between (1) the actual wealth distribution in the U.S., (2) the public's perception of the wealth distribution, and (3) the public's perception of the optimal wealth distribution. 

Other statistics: 
* According to [the EPI](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-compensation-2018/), "CEO compensation has grown 940% since 1978". In contrast, the typical worker's compensation has grown just 12%. This leads to a situation where CEOs make 278 times as much as the average worker. 
* MotherJones has created articles with punchy graphics [here](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph/), [here](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/one-percent-income-inequality-ows/), and [here](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/taxes-richest-americans-charts-graph/). A more nuanced discussion of the means by which economic inequality is perpetuated (which will not be found there) will happen in the "Classism" and "Capitalism and Economics" chapters.

Finally, economic inequality along lines of race, gender, and sexuality are found in the chapters "Racism", "Sexism", and "Homophobia and Transphobia". 

## Political Demographics

According to [2018 polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/), 50% of Americans lean Democrat, compared to 42% who lean Republican. However, only 33% of the population identify *precisely* as Democrats and only 26% identify *precisely* as Republicans (37% identify as independent). 

*Interesting note*: Since 1994, the percentage of Democrats hasn’t changed, but the percentage of independents has risen by 7%, while the percentage of Republicans has dropped by 7%.

*Political leaning by sex:*
* 48% of men lean Republican and 44% lean Democrat. 
* 56% of women lean Democrat and 37% lean Republican. 

*Political leaning by race:*
* 51% of white people lean Republican and 43% lean Democrat. 
* 84% of black people lean Democrat and 8% lean Republican. 
* 63% of Hispanic people lean Democrat and 28% lean Republican. 
* 65% of Asian-Americans lean Democrat and 27% lean Republican. 

*Political leaning by education:*
* For those with no college education, 47% lean Republican and 45% lean Democrat.
* For those who did not graduate from college but still have some college education, 47% lean Democrat and 45% lean Republican. 
* For those with a college degree but no postgraduate experience, 54% lean Democrat and 39% lean Republican. 
* For those with postgraduate experience, 63% lean Democrat and 31% lean Republican. 

Following is a (slightly dated) discussion of income differences between Republicans and Democrats. 
* According to [this infographic](https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2012/10/what-you-earn-vs-how-you-vote-infographic) from PayScale's study of the 2012 election, the poorer you are, the more likely you were to vote for Obama. Among voters making less than $25,000 per year, over 60% supported Obama (compared to just over 30% who supported Romney). 
* Obama beat Romney up until around $70,000 per year, at which point Romney became more popular. Romney's support continued to rise: with voters making over $200,000 per year, he enjoyed 55% support.
* This trend, where poorer people tend to vote Democrat, was true in 2009 ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/05/21/section-1-party-affiliation-and-composition/)) and more recently, in 2016 ([source](https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/09/09-13-16-Party-ID-Combined-Detailed-Tables.pdf)). In particular, among those making less than $30,000 per year, 60% leaned Democrat. Republicans enjoyed a slim (3-4%) advantage among the richer groups. 

Many low-income Republicans agree with progressive economic policies, but far fewer high-income Republicans do ([source](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/on-the-money)). Interestingly, this pattern *does not hold* for Democrats, which are fairly unified in their support for progressive economic measures regardless of income (high-income Democrats are actually *more* likely, in some cases, to support progressive economic policies). The report also finds that Republicans with more economically progressive ideas (that is, poorer Republicans) were more likely to vote against Trump in the 2016 election. 

*Political leaning by religion:*
White non-Hispanic evangelical Protestants are more likely to lean Republican (77%) than Democrat (18%). However, mainline Protestants are more even at 53% Rep. and 41% Dem. 
On the other hand, black Protestants are more likely to be Democrat supporters than arbitrary black people: 87% lean Democrat and 7% lean Republican. 
Mormons are overwhelmingly Republican (72% to 22%), and non-Hispanic white Catholics have recently shifted towards Republicans (from 45-45 in 1994 to 54-40 today). 
Jewish people are overwhelmingly Democrat (67% to 31%), as are religiously unaffiliated people (68% to 22%). 

Urban voters lean heavily Democrat (62% to 31%), suburban counties barely lean Democrat (47% to 45%), and rural countries lean Republican (54% to 38%). 

### Intelligence and Political Leanings

[Stankov and Lee 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022115611749) found that “gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, cognitive test performance, and governance indicators were found to be low in the most conservative group and high in the most liberal group”. In the earlier study [Stankov 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609000051) by the same author, it was found that "conservatism correlates negatively with measures of cognitive ability and educational achievement at both individual and country levels of analysis." 

[Hodson and Busseri 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206), a study carried out in the U.K., found that "lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups" (note that in this context "mediated" means *brought about by*). The study, which controlled for education and socioeconomic status, also found that there was "a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact."

[Onraet et al. 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2027) is a meta-analysis on the association of cognitive ability and right-wing ideological attitudes. In particular, it found that "fifty-seven studies showed negative relations, nine showed positive relations and one showed a correlation of approximately 0. The meta-analysis (for all results, see Table 2) revealed an overall moderate negative relation, *r*=-.20, *p*<.001. In other words, lower cognitive ability was associated with the stronger endorsement of right-wing ideological attitudes."

Another meta-analysis [Jost et al. 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12784934/) of 88 different samples finds that "several psychological variables predict political conservatism". Explicitly, "death anxiety", "system instability", "dogmatism-intolerance of ambiguity", "needs for order, structure, and closure", and "fear of threat and loss" were positive predictors of conservatism. In contrast, "openness to experience", "uncertainty tolerance", "integrative complexity", and "self-esteem" were negative predictors of conservatism. The meta-analysis concludes by saying that their results suggest that "the core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and justification of inequality and is motivated by needs that vary situationally and dispositionally to manage uncertainty and threat."

Studies of party affiliation are less conclusive. [Carl 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001081) finds that “individuals who identify as Republican have slightly higher verbal intelligence than those who identify as Democrat”. He says that this difference is largely (but not totally) accountable to conservatives' increased socioeconomic status (see the section “Intelligence and Class” for more on how socioeconomic status is related to IQ) and suggests that socially conservative Republicans' lower intelligence is moderated by higher intellignce among classically liberal Republicans. Yet this study is critiqued by [Ganzach 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616300277), which finds that (1) Carl did not properly control for socioeconomic status and racial identity and (2) that once these are controlled for, "there are no important associations between \[cognitive ability and party identity\]", either using Carl's metric for cognitive ability or the others that are introduced by Ganzach 2016. 

A year later, Ganzach critiques himself and Carl in [Ganzach 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616302677). This study notes that academic consensus is that "intelligence is positively correlated with liberal attitudes", and wonders why, even after controlling for socioeconomic status and racial identity, there is no positive correlatation between intelligence and Democratic Affiliation (since Democratic Affiliation and liberal attitudes are closely correlated). Ganzach realizes that "both Carl and Ganzach's conclusions were based on the GSS surveys conducted between 1972 and 2012, years in which the relationship between social and economic attitudes and party affiliation in the American electorate changed considerably (Layman & Carsey, 2002)." Essentially, the point is that both of these studies are flawed as measurements of current-day associations between intelligence and party affiliation, because "although in recent years liberal attitudes are strongly associated with DA \[Democratic Affiliation\], this association was weaker in earlier times". Thus, he isolates the data by decade, and indeed finds that "the relationship between liberal attitudes and DA became more positive during the years. This positive relationship was rather weak in the 1970s and considerably strengthened in later years".

## Religious Demographics

This data comes from [this Pew Research poll](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/). 

*National Religious Distribution:*
* Christian: 70.6%
  * Evangelical Protestant: 25.4%
  * Mainline Protestant: 14.7%
  * Historically Black Protestant: 6.5%
  * Catholic: 20.8%
* Non-Christian Faiths: 5.9%
  * Jewish: 1.9%
  * Muslim: 0.9%
  * Buddhist: 0.7%
  * Hindu: 0.3%
* Unaffiliated: 22.8%
  * Atheist: 3.1%
  * Agnostic: 4.0%
  * Nothing in particular: 15.8%
* Don’t know: 0.6%

Even in cities and states that are, in common parlance, considered “leftist" or "atheist”, Christianity is a majority or plurality: 
* Seattle is 52% Christian and 37% Unaffiliated. 
* San Francisco is 48% Christian and 35% Unaffiliated. 

This is important to consider in a time when a popular talking point from conservative and other right-leaning politicians is that Christians are oppressed or under attack. While there is data to suggest that Christianity is [losing its previous near-ubiquity in modern America](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/), it is still the dominant religion both in terms of numbers and sociopolitical power (for a discussion on the latter, see the section "The Sociopolitical Power of Christianity").
