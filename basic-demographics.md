# Basic Demographics

## National Demographics

The data is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts page, accessible [here](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219). Note that all data is as of July 1st, 2019. The United States’ population is approximately 328 million as of July 1st, 2019 (as of 2020, sources estimate 329 million). It has grown approximately 6.3% since 2010. More detailed data is [here](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf). *Note:* in this section “people counted by the U.S. Census” is shortened to “people” for the sake of brevity.

*Age Distribution:*
* 6% of people are under 5 years of age.
* 22.3% of people are under 18 years of age. 
* 61.2% of people are between 18 and 65 years of age.
* 16.5% of people are over 65 years of age.

*Sex Distribution:* 50.8% of people are biologically female and 49.2% of people are biologically male. 

*Racial and Ethnic Distribution:*
* 76.3% of the population is white.
* 60.1% is white non-Hispanic or Latinx. 
* 18.5% is Hispanic or Latinx.
* 13.4% of the population is Black/African-American.
* 5.9% of the population is Asian. 
* 1.3% of the population is American Indian and Alaska Native.
* 0.2% of the population is Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.
* Only 2.8% of the population is two or more races. 

*Interesting Facts:*
* 13.5% of people are foreign-born. 
* 21.5% of families speak a language other than English at home. 
* 88.8% of families have a computer at home (only 80.4% have an internet subscription). 
* 31.5% of people over 25 in the U.S. have a Bachelor’s degree (or higher). 
* 10.0% of people under 65 do not have healthcare. 
* 11.8% of people are under the poverty line. 

It is difficult to find information about LGBT+ demographics (this is an issue of epistemic injustice). However, this (slightly dated) [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx) estimates that approximately 4.5% of people identify as LGBT+ (about 5% of women and 4% of men). However, since Gallup finds this number is rising, and this poll is from 2017, it is likely an underestimate. One's likelihood to identify as LGBT+ is heavily correlated with age: 8.2% of millenials identify as LGBT+ compared to just just 1.4% of the Silent Generation (and 2.4% of the Boomer Generation). 

Another slightly dated [study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) from the UCLA Williams Institute suggests that only 0.6% of people identify as transgender. The Williams Insitute also provides some more interesting stats on LGBT+ people and their situation [here](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT#demographic).

*An interesting note:* according to a Gallup poll, people significantly overestimate [the LGBT population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/259571/americans-greatly-overestimate-gay-population.aspx) and [the Black/Hispanic population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/4435/Public-Overestimates-US-Black-Hispanic-Populations.aspx). 

## Wealth Demographics

The [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/) created a series of charts that illustrate economic inequality in this country. The first graph focuses on the increasing income inequality, and the second focuses on the increasing weal inequality. 

Income Inequality             |  Wealth Inequality
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

In particular, the report finds that, in the past two decades, growth in median household income (accounting for inflation) "slowed to an annual average rate of only 0.3%", compared with 1.2% for the previous three deacdes. Similarly, it finds that the median household wealth of American families is "currently no higher than its level two decades ago". This inequality can be traced to the Great Recession: the report finds that the wealthiest families are "the only ones to have experienced gains in wealth in the years after the start of the Great Recession in 2007." In the top quintile, median net worth increased by 13% between 2007 and 2016; in contrast, "the net worth of families in lower tiers of wealth decreased by at least 20%" (and up to 39%, in the case of the second-to-bottom quintile) in the same timeframe.

## Political Demographics

According to [2018 polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/), 50% of Americans lean Democrat, compared to 42% who lean Republican. However, only 33% of the population identify *precisely* as Democrats and only 26% identify *precisely* as Republicans (37% are independent). Since 1994, the percentage of Democrats hasn’t changed, but the percentage of independents has risen by 7% (the percentage of Republicans has dropped by 7%).

*Political leaning by sex:*
* 48% of men lean Republican and 44% lean Democrat. 
* 56% of women lean Democrat and 37% lean Republican. 

*Political leaning by race:*
* 51% of white people lean Republican and 43% lean Democrat. 
* 84% of black people lean Democrat and 8% lean Republican. 
* 63% of Hispanic people lean Democrat and 28% lean Republican. 
* 65% of Asian-Americans lean Democrat and 27% lean Republican. 

*Political leaning by education:*
* For those with no college education, 47% lean Republican and 45% lean Democrat.
* For those who did not graduate from college but still have some college education, 47% lean Democrat and 45% lean Republican. 
* For those with a college degree but no postgraduate experience, 54% lean Democrat and 39% lean Republican. 
* For those with postgraduate experience, 63% lean Democrat and 31% lean Republican. 

[Studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022115611749) have found that “gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, cognitive test performance, and governance indicators” are lower in conservative countries than liberal countries. Furthermore, [social conservatism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222682950_Conservatism_and_cognitive_ability) is negatively correlated with tested cognitive ability ([here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206) is another corroborating study). On the other hand, [this study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265852713_Cognitive_ability_and_party_identity_in_the_United_States) finds that “individuals who identify as Republican have slightly higher verbal intelligence than those who identify as Democrat” but mostly attributes this difference to increased socioeconomic status (see the section The “Black-White IQ Gap” for more on how SES is related to IQ). It agrees that there is lower intelligence among those who are socially conservative. 

*Political leaning by religion:*
White non-Hispanic evangelical Protestants are more likely to lean Republican (77%) than Democrat (18%). However, mainline Protestants are more even at 53% Rep. and 41% Dem. 
On the other hand, black Protestants are more likely to be Democrat supporters than arbitrary black people: 87% lean Democrat and 7% lean Republican. 
Mormons are overwhelmingly Republican (72% to 22%), and non-Hispanic white Catholics have recently shifted towards Republicans (from 45-45 in 1994 to 54-40 today). 
Jewish people are overwhelmingly Democrat (67% to 31%), as are religiously unaffiliated people (68% to 22%). 

Urban voters lean heavily Democrat (62% to 31%), suburban counties barely lean Democrat (47% to 45%), and rural countries lean Republican (54% to 38%). 


## Religious Demographics

This data comes from [this Pew Research poll](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/). 

*National Religious Distribution:*
* Christian: 70.6%
  * Evangelical Protestant: 25.4%
  * Mainline Protestant: 14.7%
  * Historically Black Protestant: 6.5%
  * Catholic: 20.8%
* Non-Christian Faiths: 5.9%
  * Jewish: 1.9%
  * Muslim: 0.9%
  * Buddhist: 0.7%
  * Hindu: 0.3%
* Unaffiliated: 22.8%
  * Atheist: 3.1%
  * Agnostic: 4.0%
  * Nothing in particular: 15.8%
* Don’t know: 0.6%

Even in cities and states that are considered “atheist”, Christianity is a majority or plurality: 
* Seattle is 52% Christian and 37% Unaffiliated. 
* San Francisco is 48% Christian and 35% Unaffiliated. 

This is important to consider in a time when a popular talking point from conservative and other right-leaning politicians is that Christians are oppressed or under attack. While there is data to suggest that Christianity is [losing its previous near-ubiquity in modern America](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/), it is still the dominant religion both in terms of numbers and sociopolitical power (for a discussion on the latter, see the section "The Sociopolitical Power of Christianity").
