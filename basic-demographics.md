# Basic Demographics

## National Demographics

The data is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts page, accessible [here](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219). Note that all data is as of July 1st, 2019. The United States’ population is approximately 328 million as of July 1st, 2019 (as of 2020, sources estimate 329 million). It has grown approximately 6.3% since 2010. More detailed data is [here](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf). *Note:* in this section “people counted by the U.S. Census” is shortened to “people” for the sake of brevity.

It is difficult to find information about LGBT+ demographics (this is an issue of epistemic injustice). However, this (slightly dated) [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx) estimates that approximately 4.5% of people identify as LGBT+ (about 5% of women and 4% of men). However, since Gallup finds this number is rising, and this poll is from 2017, it is likely an underestimate. One's likelihood to identify as LGBT+ is heavily correlated with age: 8.2% of millenials identify as LGBT+ compared to just just 1.4% of the Silent Generation (and 2.4% of the Boomer Generation). 

Another slightly dated [study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) from the UCLA Williams Institute suggests that only 0.6% of people identify as transgender. The Williams Insitute also provides some more interesting stats on LGBT+ people and their situation [here](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT#demographic).

*An interesting note:* according to a Gallup poll, people significantly overestimate [the LGBT population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/259571/americans-greatly-overestimate-gay-population.aspx) and [the Black/Hispanic population](https://news.gallup.com/poll/4435/Public-Overestimates-US-Black-Hispanic-Populations.aspx).

## Religious Demographics

*National Religious Distribution:*
* Christian: 70.6%
  * Evangelical Protestant: 25.4%
  * Mainline Protestant: 14.7%
  * Historically Black Protestant: 6.5%
  * Catholic: 20.8%
* Non-Christian Faiths: 5.9%
  * Jewish: 1.9%
  * Muslim: 0.9%
  * Buddhist: 0.7%
  * Hindu: 0.3%
* Unaffiliated: 22.8%
  * Atheist: 3.1%
  * Agnostic: 4.0%
  * Nothing in particular: 15.8%
* Don’t know: 0.6%

Even in cities and states that are considered “atheist”, Christianity is a majority or plurality: 
* Seattle is 52% Christian and 37% Unaffiliated. 
* San Francisco is 48% Christian and 35% Unaffiliated. 

This is important to consider in a time when a popular talking point from conservative and other right-leaning politicians is that Christians are oppressed or under attack. While there is data to suggest that Christianity is [losing its previous near-ubiquity in modern America](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/), it is still the dominant religion in terms of sociopolitical power (for more, see the section "The Sociopolitical Power of Christianity").
