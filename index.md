## Introduction

This repository aims to ground discourse about American politics in empirical and logical truth. It collects academic evidence, news stories, and various arguments on important issues. Before we can discuss how the world ought to change, we must agree on how the world *is*. I am always collecting new perspectives and evidence for this project.

*Note:* Allegedly, one can place [sci-hub.tw/](https://sci-hub.tw/) or [scihub.wikicn.top/](https://scihub.wikicn.top/) before the URL of a study to bypass any paywalls it might be hidden behind. I wouldn’t know, however, as I’ve never done it.

The project is currently *in progress*. Sections without clickable links are not yet completed. Sections with the label \[TBP\] are "to be planned"; the outline for these sections may not even be filled out yet.

This document was inspired by [The Ultimate Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE), which drew on the document [Systemic Racism in The United States](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIVHtml45EcMSi3suI5Zn1ymef5Y-8hnHbeY6kxp-ec). It is also inspired by the [Source Library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UhneOJvvO9vzHIUWfgKWJCCFi0LDNj_3p6LGBkIo6mU/); the idea to host this project on Github Pages came from the Source Library's author doing the same [here](https://nb419.github.io/source-library/). I read through each of these documents, choosing the best sources from each to add to my own research.
