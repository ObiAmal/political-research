# Introduction

This repository aims to ground political discourse in empirical and rational truth. It collects academic evidence, news stories, and various arguments on politically important issues. Before we can discuss how the world ought to change, we must agree on how the world *is*. I am always collecting intellectually rigorous evidence for this project; if you have some, my Discord is **@ObiAmal#2764**.
