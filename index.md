## Introduction

This repository aims to ground American political discourse in empirical and rational truth. It collects academic evidence, news stories, and various arguments on politically important issues. Before we can discuss how the world ought to change, we must agree on how the world *is*. I am always collecting intellectually rigorous evidence for this project; if you have some, my Discord is **@ObiAmal#2764**.

The project is currently *in progress*. Sections without clickable links are not yet completed.

### Inspiration and Credit
This document was inspired by [The Ultimate Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE), which drew on the document [Systemic Racism in The United States](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIVHtml45EcMSi3suI5Zn1ymef5Y-8hnHbeY6kxp-ec). It is also inspired by the [Source Library](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UhneOJvvO9vzHIUWfgKWJCCFi0LDNj_3p6LGBkIo6mU/); the idea to host this project on Github Pages came from the Source Library's author doing the same [here](https://nb419.github.io/source-library/). I read through each of these documents, choosing the best sources from each to add to my own research.
